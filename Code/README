Build instructions:

You just use "make" but must specificy the machine on which you're
building through the environment variable $HEMELB_MACHINE:

$ export HEMELB_MACHINE=OSX
$ make

or on the command line:
$ make HEMELB_MACHINE=OSX

Object files and the binary will be in the "build" subdirectory.

"make clean" will clean just the directory you're in.
"make clean_all" will clean the whole build.
